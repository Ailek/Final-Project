## Overview
Gains, brah!

This is a web app that allows users to create custom workout routines and track their progress.

Create an account, make a routine, and log your progress during each workout. Using the Meteor framework for NodeJS, the application can work both on your computer as well as mobile device. 

The ability to move seemlessly between computer to mobile, is what makes our app ideal for those looking to get in shape. Spare your thumbs by navigating to our webpage on your home computer to make a routine. And when you're ready to hit the gym, use the mobile app to log your progress between each set.

Please try out the deployed app in Heroku, found [here](http://STILLNEEDSANAME.herokuapp.com).

## Functionality
On the Front End, the app uses `React` JavaScript Framework with `React Router` and `Redux`. And for styling, the `Material-Ui` Component Library and `React Grid System` were used.

On the Back End, the app uses the `Meteor` Framework for `NodeJS`. Within Meteor, we persist data using `MongoDB` and call upon the `accounts-ui` package for user authenication. Naturally, `Express` is used as the router, and `bcrypt-nodejs` for hashing user passwords.
